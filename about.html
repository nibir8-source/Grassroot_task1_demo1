                    "“Lit The Light” is a voluntary services group which supports Visually Impaired students by helping them in their academics, extracurricular activities, job placements and overall growth.<br/>It was the vision of a single person, S.N. Barath, that sparked this endeavor. After attending reading sessions for a year, a visually impaired student of Government High School in Poonamalle scored 960 in his class 12 board examination. This was an eye-opener for Barath.He now realised that a little help could go a long way in helping such students. In 2012, along with a few of his colleagues Ram Kumar, Ravikant, Adhiyan and Sakthivel, he began this journey of Social Service. Lit the Light started functioning from 26th Jan 2012.<br/>We are entirely a volunteer based service organization which is operating in India (Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Vellore, Erode, Karur, Cuddalore and Salem), USA, UK, Bahrain & Gulf countries." </p>
